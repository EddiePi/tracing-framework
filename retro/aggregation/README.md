The resourceaggregation project provides the ability to aggregate resource consumption counters locally, and publish them periodically using pubsub.

It also provides methods to subscribe to reports of resource usage.

The design of this package is pretty bad, as it could be generalized to general purpose counters.  Hopefully later it can be cleaned up.
