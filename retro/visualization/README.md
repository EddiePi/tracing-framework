### Retro Visualization Server

This project contains a simple visualization server to show real-time resource consumption.

After building, run the `visualization-server` executable in the `target/appassembler/bin` folder.

This will run a server on port [localhost:4081](http://localhost:4081).  The port can be configured with the property `resource-reporting.visualization.webui-port`

The visualization server will visualize any resource reports currently being generated by Retro.
