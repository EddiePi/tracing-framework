# Brown University Tracing Framework

https://brownsys.github.io/tracing-framework

This repository contains multiple projects from the Brown University systems research group, such as X-Trace, Retro, and Pivot Tracing

These projects are all instrumentation libraries.  They are intended for use with a new or existing system.  We also have some pre-instrumented forks of some well known systems:
* [HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, YARN version 2.7.2](https://github.com/brownsys/hadoop/tree/brownsys-pivottracing-2.7.2)
* HBase (*coming soon*)

This documentation is incomplete and in progress.  For questions, please use the [pivot-tracing-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pivot-tracing-users) Google group.
